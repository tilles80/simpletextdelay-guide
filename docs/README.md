**Simple Text Delay** is a ScriptUI for After Effects that automates some tasks for text animation, including delay, using the *Expression Selector* and 2 *Sliders Controls*.

It's a tool based on my own experience and needs as a motion designer, having to do the same animation over and over, as quick as possible and obviously, with nice results.

The idea is to simplify the making of text animation, but using as few controls as possible, so you can still have the control over the animation. 

## Basic usage:<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
1) Set the IN and OUT points of your text layers and spread them over the timeline.
2) Select all text layers, including Photoshop text layers.
3) Set your options and click the "create" button.

## What you can expect:<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

* 3 to 5 lines of commented expressions. Change as you need.
* Based on IN and OUT points of the layers, so you can apply to a bunch of layers at once, without having to tweak keyframes later.
* Easings aren't made of crazy expressions. Just common curves that you can adjust.
* No lots of controls, just 2 sliders.
* Photoshop text layers are welcome.

All these points will be covered in depth throughout this guide, including some workflow tips, modifier keys and more.
